# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### DJ Pad Buttons
The DJ pad buttons are used to mute and unmute the different instruments in the song. These are hardcoded buttons which respond to specific instruments in the chosen song. Only the first four buttons respond to an instrument for this song, but more have been added for future songs that may have more.

1.	Orange – Bassline
2.	Red – Main Arp
3.	Blue – Drums
4.	Yellow – Drum set 2

### Volume Slider
The volume slider can be used to adjust the overall volume of the song. This does not update automatically and requires the user to click the Play button again for any changes to take effect.

### Mute/Unmute All
This button will toggle all the DJ Buttons either off or on depending on its current state, and its emoji will change to reflect which is currently selected. The song must be processed again in order for these changes to be made.

### BPM Input
The BPM input changes the beats per minute. This works from range 0.1 – 0.8 as going any faster can result in audio delays/unexpected behaviour. The Play button must be clicked for changes to be set.

### Toggle Buttons
The toggle buttons are used to toggle off/on different audio effects. The first one adds the Stretch effect, and the second one adds the Vowel effect.

### Song Code
All song code has been supplied from the starter code of the assignment and can be found in the tunes.js file. Minor adjustments have been made for additional instruments and audio effects.
